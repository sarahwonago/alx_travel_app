# Alx Travel App
## About the Project
The alxtravelapp project is a real-world Django application that serves as the foundation for a travel listing platform. This milestone focuses on setting up the initial project structure, configuring a robust database, and integrating tools to ensure API documentation and maintainable configurations. The aim is to equip learners with industry-standard best practices for starting and managing Django-based projects efficiently.

This milestone will teach you to set up a scalable backend, integrate MySQL for database management, and use Swagger for automated API documentation. These foundational steps are critical in preparing the application for future features and seamless team collaboration.

## Learning Objective
As a professional developer, this task will enable you to:
### Master Advanced Project Initialization:
- Learn to bootstrap Django projects with modular, production-ready configurations.
- Employ environment variable management for secure and scalable settings.
  
### Integrate Key Developer Tools:
- Set up and use Swagger (via drf-yasg) for API documentation.
- Implement CORS headers and MySQL configurations for robust API interactions.
  
### Collaborate Effectively Using Git:
- Structure your projects for team collaboration with a version-controlled setup.
  
### Adopt Industry Best Practices:
- Follow best practices in managing dependencies, database configurations, and application structure.
  
### Requirements
To successfully complete this milestone, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:
- Familiarity with Django and Django REST Framework.
- Knowledge of MySQL and database management.
- Understanding of version control using Git.
- A basic grasp of environment variable management using django-environ.

## Key Highlights
Project Initialization:
